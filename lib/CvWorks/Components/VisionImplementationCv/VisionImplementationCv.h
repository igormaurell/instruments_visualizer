* \file VisionImplementationCv.h
* \brief This file defines the Viscv component, which implements high-level computer vision methods using OpenCv library.
* \see Viscv
*
* \defgroup Viscv Viscv
* \brief This component groups some detectors and trackers based on OpenCv.
*
* This component provides some detection and tracking methods (such as Haar Cascade Classifier detectors, Lucas-Kanade
* tracker, SIFT based detection, etc) based on OpenCv library.
* The methods can be usefull in applications, as well as serve as examples on how to implement CvWorks interfaces.
