* \brief This module contains the generic interfaces used throughout the framework.
*
* The objective of these interfaces is to define minimal functionalities that detectors, trackers, categorizers, etc should implement.
*
* The image type and object is generalized by using templates, so these interfaces can be implemented for different types of
* images (e.g. OpenCv, Kinect, stereo cameras, CPL cloud points, etc) and for different types of objects (e.g. faces, cars, gestures, etc).

    for a people detector.

    This interface provides a minimal and generic description of an object detector. The interface has only one method: detect(), which receives an input
	image and returns a vector of objects found within the image. 
	Both the image and object types are generic.

/// A IdentifiedMultiTracker is a tracker for multiple objects, each having its own ID.
/** While the Tracker interface defines that only one object is tracked, this interface assumes multiple objects
 * are tracked at the same time.
 *
 * To track more than one object at the same time (for example, tracking multiple faces), one solution is to implement
 * interface Tracker<TImg,std::vector<TObj>>. With this approach, there is no distinction between objects, which is ok
 * for some applications but inadequate for others.
 *
 * For example, a multiple person tracker should provide an ID for each tracked person that is consistent along the video,
 * and not only an unordered vector of persons.
 *
 * The IdentifiedMultiTracker interface defines a tracker that tracks multiple objects where each object has a distinct
 * ID. This tracker provides a std::map<long,TObj> where each object has a unique key.
